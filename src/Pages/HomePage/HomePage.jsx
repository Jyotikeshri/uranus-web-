            Uranus, the ruler of Aquarius, starts 2024 in retrograde, going
            direct on Saturday, January 27, then retrogrades again on Sunday,
            September 1. This suggests ongoing evolution in your home life and
            personal growth.{" "}
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Uranus champions individuality, social justice, and authenticity.
            During its retrograde, focus on living by your values and perhaps
            engage more actively in humanitarian efforts.

            In 2024, the location of the Sun on the March equinox is in the
            constellation of Pisces but also on the border of Aquarius. So, 
            <b>we are slowly moving into a new age, from Pisces to Aquarius.</b>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>
              Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet that governs innovation,
              technology, and surprising events.
            </b>{" "}
            Uranus perfectly mirrors Aquarius' distinctive attitude,
            complementing the nontraditional nature of these visionary air
            signs.
